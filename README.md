  * Because the workers have very little computer knowledge (they do not contemplate a solution with programs like excel for this reason)
  * Prefer to use a traditional solution to this problem (by hand)

* Solution
  * An ultra-intuitive program is needed (only click and use)
  * Whith very simple, effective and powerful options
  * Goal 1: No matter the computer knowledge, any worker can use the software.
  * Goal 2: Complete diet sheet in 5 minutes (600% faster)
